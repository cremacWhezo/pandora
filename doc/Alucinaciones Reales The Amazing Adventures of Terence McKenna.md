In this book, McKenna recounts his encounters with exotic plants, animals, and indigenous people, as well as his experiments with psilocybin mushrooms and ayahuasca, a powerful brew that induces visions and altered states of consciousness. He also describes his theory of the "transcendental object at the end of time", a mysterious phenomenon that he believed was guiding human evolution and history.

It is also available in Spanish as *Alucinaciones Reales*, which you can download for free from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

Whether you agree or disagree with him, Terence McKenna was a unique and influential figure who left a lasting legacy in the fields of psychedelia, spirituality, and philosophy. His book *Alucinaciones Reales* is a testament to his courage, curiosity, and creativity.
  
Terence McKenna was not only a storyteller, but also a thinker and a visionary. He had many original and provocative ideas about the nature of reality, consciousness, culture, and the future of humanity. He was not afraid to challenge the status quo and to question the assumptions and beliefs that shape our society. He was also a master of language, using words as tools to create new meanings and possibilities. Here are some of his quotes that reflect his wisdom and wit:
 
- "What we call reality is in fact nothing more than a culturally sanctioned and linguistically reinforced hallucination."[^1^]
- "Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed."[^2^]
- "You are a divine being. You matter, you count. You come from realms of unimaginable power and light, and you will return to those realms."[^3^]
- "Stop consuming images and start producing them."[^3^]
- "Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong."[^2^]
- "The most beautiful things in the universe are inside the human mind."[^2^]
- "The Imagination is the golden pathway to everywhere."[^2^]

These quotes show that Terence McKenna was a man of profound insight, creativity, and courage. He invited us to explore the mysteries of our own minds and to expand our horizons beyond the ordinary. He also warned us of the dangers of conformity, ignorance, and apathy. He was a true visionary who inspired many people to seek their own truth and to create their own culture.
